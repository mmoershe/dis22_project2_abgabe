Design thinking is a process that involves creative problem-solving, critical thinking, and collaboration. It is a flexible approach that can be adapted to different learning contexts and stages of education. 1. Primary School (Ages 5-11) a. Introduction to Problem-Solving SkillsDesign thinking can be introduced to students at a young age by focusing on the development of problem-solving skills. For example, in math or science classes, students can learn to break down a problem into smaller steps and test solutions
